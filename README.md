# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
The problem the code aims to solve is linear regression using the least squares method. The challenge lies in finding the optimal parameters (theta) that minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual values.

## Description
The code solves the problem by implementing the least squares linear regression algorithm. It defines functions for the linear hypothesis, error calculation, and uses the normal equation to find the optimal theta values.

## Installation
The code doesn't need installation as it's a Python script. However, it requires the 'numpy', 'matplotlib', and 'seaborn' libraries. Seaborn is installed using the command !pip install seaborn within the script.

## Usage
The code generates random data points, performs least squares regression, and includes functions for viewing data relationships and performing gradient descent optimization.

### The Core Team
Only one person, Olajuwon Aina worked on this project.
